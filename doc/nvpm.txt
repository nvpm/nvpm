-1. New Version Warning                                          *nvpm-future* {

  The NVPM  projects are going through a hard reset in their code paradigm and
  the organizational structure. The code is being ported to an Object Oriented
  paradigm, which will allow  me to solve  problems more efficiently. However,
  although this does not affect the end-user,  the  plug-in structure is being
  changed a bit.

  The  plug-in  now  called  nvpm (this plug-in, the frozen one) will be split
  into at least 3 other plug-ins. They are:

  1. `flux`: plug-in will be in charge of parsing the project file syntax into
  a data structure usable by the next plug-ins

  2. `proj`: will  be  in  charge with the project management itself. It's gonna
  perform  all  navigation  and  even  some new housekeeping operations in the
  project's file structure. For this, proj  will  use the data structure built
  by `flux`, as mentioned above.

  3. `line`: will be  resposible for constructing the tab and status lines with
  many  more  features,  including  a new syntax that's being developed as we
  speak. You see, there are many plug-ins  of  the sort out there, and all of
  them  seem  to  require  the  user  learn  how  to  manipulate   VimL  data
  structures  such  as  lists  and  dictionaries.  I'm  sure  that's the best
  solution when performance is concerned, but it's done at the  peril  of the
  begginers.  I  intend  to  attend both persons. This new syntax is gonna be
  treated by the `flux` plug-in as well.

  The  `zoom`  plug-in already undergone  these  changes and it's no longer part
  of the current  (and  frozen)  nvpm. The same will happen with it's parsing,
  navigation and management, and the  lines  drawing,  which  is now all being
  done by nvpm alone. This is starting to get in my nerves, hence  the change.

  For those who still want to use the current (and frozen) version can install
  it  using  the  git  tag  `frozen`.  Using vim-plug is recommended for this,
  because you can explicitly specify that by the following:

    Plug 'https://gitlab.com/nvpm/nvpm' , {'tag' : 'frozen'}

  Note, only upon reinstalling the plug-in will work. If you update it, it
  won't work.

  Users  must  do this, because I also intend to use the repository nvpm (this
  repository) as  a  pack  of  all plug-ins together. This will be perfect for
  those users (myself included!) who just want to use all my plug-ins, without
  having to go through the trouble  of  installing  each  and everyone of them
  separately. So in the near future, those users will just  have  to  do  this

    Plug 'https://gitlab.com/nvpm/nvpm' , {'branch' : 'main'}

  and have all of them will be installed. Easy hum?

  Although  this  helps,  some  users  may  be concerned with unused memory by
  having all plugins installed, and not using  some of them all the time. This
  scenario  will never happen, because all plug-ins  are  now  making  use  of
  Vim/Neovim  buil-in feature of automatic loading. In other words, nearly all
  variables and functions will be loaded (occupy RAM memory) upon demand only,
  except some that will be necessary to construct the command interfacing with
  the user (the commands themselves). Note, the current frozen nvpm plug-in is
  not making using of this awesome feature!

  I appreciate your understanding.

  I'm  not  sure  how  you will want to configure NVPM, but the following have
  been known to work well  for  several users. They are kind of an agreed upon
  settings. Most of them are already with their default values. Just drop them
  into your `init.vim` and you should be good to go!

 2. Introduction                                                  *nvpm-intro* {

  NVPM  stands  for Neovim Project Manager. It's mission is to assist the user
  on managing large  quantities  of  files in any project. The main goal is to
  create a tree-like structure in order  to overcome the linearity of Neovim's
  bufferlist.

  For  small projects, Neovim's bufferlist will do just fine. You can open all
  the files  in  different  tabs  and move around with  ease. The problem only
  appears  when you increase the number  of  files  and  directories  in  your
  project.

  To  exemplify this, we can simulate the creation of a project. For exemple a
  C Library  that  handles  geometric calculations called LibGeo. This project
  may start small, say:

  $tree ~/libgeo/
  libgeo/
  ├── main.c
  └── readme.txt

  0 directories, 2 files

  In  such  cases,  the  user  can  open  each  file  at  a time and edit them
  separately.  But  very  soon the situation can change into separate  modules
  for the library.  Say:


  tree ~/libgeo/

  libgeo/
  ├── main.c
  ├── readme.txt
  └── src
      ├── line.c
      ├── line.h
      ├── plane.c
      ├── plane.h
      ├── point.c
      └── point.h

  1 directory, 8 files

  And  it  can  always  get  uglier! The user may want to make separate tests,
  assisted by a Makefile. Also,  as  soon  as  the modules increase in number,
  more hierarchies may be necessary.

  And  what  about creating a git repository, a documentation folder, install,
  uninstall and  helper  scripts.  Well, very quickly, the user might face the
  following structure of files:


  tree -a libgeo/

  libgeo/
  ├── bin
  ├── doc
  │   ├── libgeo-dev.txt
  │   └── libgeo.txt
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── lib

  ├── scripts
  │   ├── helper.sh
  │   ├── install.sh
  │   └── uninstall.sh

  │   │   ├── list.c
  │   │   ├── list.h
  │   │   ├── string.c
  │   │   ├── string.h
  │   │   ├── tree.c
  │   │   └── tree.h

  │   │   ├── real.h
  │   │   ├── vector.c
  │   │   └── vector.h
  │   └── shapes
  │       ├── line.c
  │       ├── line.h
  │       ├── plane.c
  │       ├── plane.h
  │       ├── point.c
  │       └── point.h
  └── test
      ├── common.h
      ├── data
      │   ├── list.c
      │   ├── list.h
      │   ├── string.c
      │   ├── string.h
      │   ├── tree.c
      │   └── tree.h
      ├── main.c
      ├── math
      │   ├── complex.c
      │   ├── complex.h
      │   ├── matrix.c
      │   ├── matrix.h
      │   ├── real.c
      │   ├── real.h
      │   ├── vector.c
      │   └── vector.h
      └── shapes
          ├── line.c
          ├── line.h
          ├── plane.c
          ├── plane.h
          ├── point.c
          └── point.h

  12 directories, 52 files

  Well  how  about  that?  Not  only  we have many more files and directories,
  divided into folders and subfolders, but also different categories of files.
  If the user tries to open them all, only  one  instance  of  Neovim won't be
  enough to keep track of them.

====================================}=========================================
 3. NVPM Language                                       *nvpm-markup-language* {

  NVPM  Markup  Language was designed in such a way to facilitate the creation
  of workspaces. Workspace means a space that you can work with/on/in.

  The  language  is  written  in what is defined as project files. Those files
  store a list of workspaces, written by the user, using NVPM Markup Language.
  The  user  may write as many project  files  as  necessary.  No  limits  was
  imposed. Normally,  only  one project file may be enough for small to medium
  sized projects.

  The  project  files  will have information regarding the meta-information of
  each project. Meta-information  is  all the information that is not (may not
  be) stored inside the files themselves (not the code). As an example:

  - the name of each file
  - the name of each directory
  - specific concepts about the files/software
  - or basically anything the user deems necessary

  What  NVPM  will  do  with  this meta-information is to read and apply actions
  accordingly, such as:

  - opening files
  - opening terminals
  - building tab and status lines
  - boring stuff the user may not wanna know

  Note. There is no other way to use NVPM but by creating at least one project
  file.  If  the  user  wants to use it, make sure to fully read this document
  first.

4.1 Location of Project Files                               *nvpm-project-files*
-----------------------------

  By default, NVPM searches for project files inside the folder ".nvpm/proj/".
  The user may change this default location with the following variable:

    g:nvpm_local_dir

  see |g:nvpm_local_dir|

  This folder must be embeded with each project. So in our LibGeo example:

  - project's location: "~/libgeo/"
  - then the folder "~/libgeo/.nvpm/proj/" must exist!

  see |nvpm-NVPMNewProject|

  Some  plugins  use  a hidden ".vim" folder to store sensible information. In
  such cases (or for no  reason  at  all),  the  user  may  want to change the
  default location for the local directory, say:

  let g:nvpm_local_dir = '.vim/nvpm'

4.2 NVPM Markup Lang Reserved Keywords           *nvpm-markup-language-keywords*
----------------------------------------

  NVPM Markup Language is having only four keywords:

    workspace
    tab
    buff
    term

  workspace: receives a name                                    *nvpm-workspace*
  --------------------------

    Syntax  : workspace <workspace-name>
    Examples:
      workspace Code
      workspace Docs
      workspace LibGeo Code
      workspace LibGeo Scripts

  tab: receives a name                                                *nvpm-tab*
  --------------------

    Syntax  : tab <tab-name>
    Examples:
      tab Main
      tab Doc

  buff: receives a name and a path                                   *nvpm-buff*
  --------------------------------

    Syntax  : buff <buffer-name> : /path/to/file
    Examples:
      buff main : src/main.c
      buff make : Makefile
      buff vnit : ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

  term: receives a name and an optional command                      *nvpm-term*
  ---------------------------------------------

    Syntax  : term <terminal-name> : [<command>]
    Examples:
      term home :         <-- $SHELL by default
      term home : bash    <-- calling bash
      term tree : ranger

  Notes.  The  user  can  put  `spaces`  and  tab characters before any of the
  keywords and around  the character `":"`. The names may have spaces as well.

  The  user  must  bear  in  mind  that even though the files above might seem
  large, it will be written only once.

4.4 Disabling Structures             *nvpm-markup-language-disabling-structures*
------------------------

  This  feature  allows the user to disable any structure from being loaded by
  adding a "*" character before any keyword. It follows the following rules:

  "*workspace WNAME" will unload the whole workspace called "WNAME"
  "*tab       TNAME" will unload the whole tab       called "TNAME"
  "*buff      BNAME" will unload the whole buffer    called "BNAME"
  "*term      TNAME" will unload the whole terminal  called "TNAME"

  this  includes  any  sub-structure under any of those elements. Meaning that
  for example by disabling a workspace, NVPM will unload all its tabs, buffers
  and terminals. Whereas by disabling a tab, NVPM will disable all its buffers
  and terminals.

For example:
-------------------------------
  workspace LibGeo

    tab Main
      buff Main : main.c
     *term Term : bash

    tab Line
      buff source:src/line.c
      buff header:src/line.h

   *tab Plane
      buff source:src/plane.c
      buff header:src/plane.h
-------------------------------

  here  both  the terminal in the first tab and the tab named as "Plane" won't
  be loaded nor  rendered  when  the  project  file is loaded. Also, the whole
  structure will be highlighted as a comment.

  This feature comes in handy when the user doesn't want to load the structure
  at  that  particular moment, but wants to keep it stored in the project file
  for later use.

  Another way to do it is to comment out all the lines of the structure. So:

-------------------------------
  workspace LibGeo

    tab Main
      buff Main : main.c
    # term Term : bash

    tab Line
      buff source:src/line.c
      buff header:src/line.h

   #  tab Plane
   #    buff source:src/plane.c
   #    buff header:src/plane.h
-------------------------------

will produce the same result as before.

4.5 Comments                                     *nvpm-markup-language-comments*
------------

To  write  a  comment,  start a line with "#". The line may have spaces before
"#".

No  inline  comments  are permited! In other words, they must not start in the
same line of any statement.

4.6 No Syntax Checker                      *nvpm-markup-language-syntax-checker*
---------------------

  Up  until  this  moment  (Jul  2021),  no checking is being done to look for
  mistakes made when writing project files.  So just be a good kid and try not
  to get fancy about it alright?

====================================}=========================================
 4. NVPM Usage                                                    *nvpm-usage* {

If  you've  reached  this  far,  I'll  assume  you  read about the NVPM Markup
Language,  and  already  know how to place and write a project file. If that's
not the case, see nvpm-markup-language.

All being said, you can load a well written project file by typing the command

  :NVPMLoadProject <project-name>

After  that it's expected of NVPM to render Neovim's tab and status lines with
the project's meta-information written by the user in the project file located
at ".nvpm/proj/<project-name>".

5.0 Example of what happens
---------------------------

As an example, consider the following project:

-------------------------------

  # Location: .nvpm/proj/Latex
  # see |example-result|

  workspace Book
    tab Home
      buff Main     : main.tex
      term Terminal : ranger
    tab Chap 01
      buff sec 01: sec1.tex
      buff sec 02: sec2.tex
    tab Chap 02
      buff sec 01: sec1.tex
      buff sec 02: sec2.tex
  workspace Meta
    tab Scripts
      buff py : script.py
      buff pl : script.pl
    tab Others
      buff make   : Makefile
      buff readme : readme.txt

-------------------------------

in  this  hypothetical use case, the hypothetical user would load this project
by doing this:

  :NVPMLoadProject Latex
                     ``-- it tab completes`

after that, NVPM would perform the following operations:

- Run over lines of the project file. Runs only once!
- Identify workspaces, tabs, buffers, and terminals
- Build the tree-like data structure(a dictionary)
- Create all buffers and terminals
- Render tab and status lines accordingly

it could/should then show something like this:

                                                               example-result

  +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

5.1 Moving through your project
-------------------------------

You  can  use  two  commands to jump to next or previous elements in the tree.
They are:

  :NVPMNext <element>
  :NVPMPrev <element>

the <element> argument can be one of these:

  buffer
  tab
  workspace

all of them in lower case, with no abbreviations.

So in the previous example, the user could for example jump to the next tab by
performing

:NVPMNext tab

after that, the user should be able to see this

optional  use <tab> to iterate over existing project files
configure
see   |g:nvpm_new_project_edit_mode|
see   |g:nvpm_load_new_project|

description

When this command is performed, NVPM will create a project file and load it by
default. For example:

  :NVPMNewProject MyProject

will create the following project file:

    # NVPM New Project File. It works!
    # --------------------------------
    #
    # --> MyProject

    workspace <workspace-name>
      tab <tab-name>

--------

syntax    :NVPMNext <element>
args      [required] one between "workspace", "tab" or "buffer"
action    jumps to next element in the tree
optional  use <tab> to iterate over possible elements
description~
Jump to next workspace  :NVPMNext workspace
Jump to next tab        :NVPMNext tab
Jump to next buffer     :NVPMNext buffer

Cycles back to first element
----------------------------

  When  the  user  reaches  the last element, by performing the command again,
  NVPM will bring the user back to the first element of same hierarchy.

counts~

  This  command  accepts  counts.  In  other  words, by typing a number before
  performing the command with a key mapping, NVPM  will use this number as the
  number of steps to walk the tree. If the used <space>  for next buffer, then
  the following actions will jump two buffers at once.

2<space>

other examples:

Doesn't reach last buffer
-------------------------

                          before
+-------------------------------...
| [buf 1]  buf 2   buf 3   buf 4

--------

syntax    :NVPMPrev <element>
args      [required] one between "workspace", "tab" or "buffer"
action    jumps to previous element in the tree
optional  use <tab> to iterate over possible elements
description~
Jump to previous workspace  :NVPMPrev workspace
Jump to previous tab        :NVPMPrev tab
Jump to previous buffer     :NVPMPrev buffer

The rest is analogous to :NVPMNext.~

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NVPMEditProjects                                         *nvpm-NVPMEditProjects*
----------------

syntax    :NVPMEditProjects
args      none
action    Enters Edit Projects mode
toggle    run again to go back to previously loaded project

description~

  Creates  the "NVPM Edit Projects" workspace which can be navigated just like
  a normal workspace by using the same keyboard mappings defined by the user.

  After  the user is done editing projects, the command can be run again to go
  back  to  the  previously  loaded  project.  All  changes  will  be  applied
  accordingly.   This   feature   (together   with  the  disabling  structures
  functionality) is very useful for quick changes in the tree.

see |nvpm-markup-language-disabling-structures|
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NVPMSaveDefaultProject                             *nvpm-NVPMSaveDefaultProject*
----------------------

syntax    :NVPMSaveDefaultProject [<project-name>]
args      [optional] zero or one
action    Saves a default project for autoload (NVPM's, not Neovim's)
optional  use <tab> to iterate over existing project files

description~

  1) Zero arguments: Saves the currently loaded project as default
  2) One argument  : Saves  the argument as default project if it matches a
  existing one

  When  starting a Neovim session in the project's root folder, NVPM will look
  for a default project. If it finds it, NVPM will load it at start up.

  This  command  saves  a file (.nvpm/default) storing the name of the default
  project to be loaded at startup. So equivalently:

  $echo "<project-name>" > .nvpm/default~

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NVPMTerminal                                                 *nvpm-NVPMTerminal*

syntax    :NVPMTerminal
args      [zero]
action    Opens a terminal that can be acessed from anywhere.

description~

  This  is a separate terminal. Different from any user defined terminal. Very
  useful for quick operations and git operations.

  To go back to last buffer, just use :NVPMNext or :NVPMPrev.

 6. Configuration                                         *nvpm-configuration* {

There are a few options the user may wanna know about. They must be set
somewhere in the user's init.vim. Here is a list with all of them set with
their default values.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Git Info Refresh Delay (miliseconds)                   *g:nvpm_line_git_delayms*
------------------------------------

type   : boolean
default: 2000 (2 seconds)
range  : 0 to infinity
action : Controls the refresh time of the git information on the statusline
description~
A timer  is run asyncronously every g:nvpm_line_git_delayms miliseconds, which
triggers the  function to retrieve git information. If g:nvpm_line_git_info is
0, then this timer is never started.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Git Information                                           *g:nvpm_line_git_info*
---------------

type   : boolean
default: 0
range  : 1 or 0
action : Displays the git branch name, and modified status, on the statusline
description~
Shows nothing if not in a git repository.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make Directory Tree                                            *g:nvpm_maketree*
-------------------

type   : boolean
default: 1
range  : 1 or 0
action : Makes the directory tree unders a filename in a buff entry.
description~
If set to 1, whenever the user creates a project file buff entry, say:

  buff file : /path/to/new/notes.txt

NVPM  will  consider  the  "/path/to/new" part as a directory path, and create
all directories that will house  the  file  "notes.txt". This function behaves
exactly like the "mkdir -p" shell command.

If the portion "/path/to/new" already exists, or it is a file, then nothing is
done. In very case where the path /path/to/new is a file, NVPM will not create
the    directory    /path/to/new,    which   will   render   the   saving   of
/path/to/new/notes.txt impossible. This is done so the user doesn't lose the
content of the file /path/to/new.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Show Project Name                                    *g:nvpm_line_show_projname*
-----------------

type   : boolean
default: 0
range  : 1 or 0
action : Displays the name of the current loaded project file
description~
When this global variable is set to 1, NVPM will display the name of the
current loaded project file on the top right-most corner of the tabline.

See |nvpm-syntax-highlight|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Closure Characters                                         *g:nvpm_line_closure*
------------------

type   : boolean
default: 1
range  : 1 or 0
action : Enables or disables current element characters
description~
When this global variable is set to 1, NVPM will enclosure current tabs and
buffers with the characters "[]" (brackets) and the current workspace with the
characters "()" (parenthesis).

They become obsolete when using syntax hightlight colors for current buffers
and tabs. See |nvpm-syntax-highlight|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inner Space Option                                      *g:nvpm_line_innerspace*
------------------

type   : boolean
default: 0
range  : 1 or 0
action : Puts one space around names of workspaces, tabs and buffers
description~
This serves the purpuse of keeping the names of workspaces, tabs, and buffers
more apart from each other.

They become obsolete when using syntax hightlight colors for current buffers
and tabs. See |nvpm-syntax-highlight|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Line Bottom Center                                    *g:nvpm_line_bottomcenter*
------------------

type   : string
default: ' ⬤ %{NVPMLINEFILENAME()}'
action : Applies string to statusline. Bottom Center. Nothing shows if empty!
description~

%f means the file relative path~

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Line Bottom Right                                      *g:nvpm_line_bottomright*
-----------------

type   : string
default: '%y%m ⬤ %l,%c/%P'
action : Applies string to statusline. Right corner. Nothing shows if empty!
description~

result~
It will display the current line, current column, virtual columns and
percentage of the file.

%y means filetype~
%m means modified flag~
%l means current line~
%c means current column~
%P means percentage~

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Project Edit Mode                             *g:nvpm_new_project_edit_mode*
---------------------

type   : boolean
default: 0
action : Enters Edit Projects Mode after running |:NVPMNewProject| command.
description~
If 1, when creating new projects with :NVPMNewProject, NVPM will create the
project if it's non-existing, and then it immediately does the following
actions:

- Loads the newly created project
- Enters Edit Projects Mode as if :NVPMEditProjects was performed

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Load New Project Option                                *g:nvpm_load_new_project*
-----------------------

type   : boolean
default: 1
action : Loads the newly created project after running |:NVPMNewProject|
description~
If 0, when creating new projects with :NVPMNewProject, NVPM will only create
the project file with default settings and do nothing else.

Note. This option is ignored when |g:nvpm_new_project_edit_mode| equals 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NVPM Local Directory                                          *g:nvpm_local_dir*
--------------------

type   : string
default: '.nvpm'
action : sets local directory for project files
description~
The user's user must have write permitions to it. Otherwise,

$man chmod~
$man chown~

NVPM will use this folder to create files regarding project files, default
project file and other future implementations that exists only in the
creator's mind yet. But for now, NVPM expects only those two:

.nvpm/proj/<list-of-project-files>
.nvpm/default
^       `------ a file
|
+---- a hidden folder

see |nvpm-markup-language|
see |nvpm-project-files|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Load Default Project                                       *g:nvpm_load_default*
--------------------

type   : boolean
default: 1
action : Permits default load project to happen
description~

When set to 1 (one), NVPM will look the file located at .nvpm/default. If it
finds it, its content will be considered as a project file name. If this file
exists, NVPM will try to load it.

If .nvpm/default stores a non-existing project file, nothing will happen.
If g:nvpm_load_default equals zero, also nothing will happen. In other words,
this completely disable the default project loading feature.

 7. Buglist                                                        *nvpm-bugs* {

|multi-terminals-after-edit|

-----------

Detected a missbehaviour regarding the creation of buffers and specially
terminals. When using the "term" keyword in a project file, the terminals are
recreated every time the project file is loaded. Not recomended to use this
feature for now. Use NVPMTerminal command instead, which works just fine.

This bug is being solved. It's origin is already know and it's being taken
care of.

 8. Functions                                                 *nvpm-functions* {

  For  now  there  is  only  one  user function that is used on the display of
  filepaths, on the statusline. This  function  treats the filepaths, in which
  it prints the word "terminal" for terminals, the  tail  of  any  help  files
  (except  those help files in relative paths) and the equivalent of using  %f
  in statusline  definitions,  otherwise.  To  quick  tests,  do  this:

  `":set statusline=%!NVPMLINEFILENAME()"`
